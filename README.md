Scikit learn is one of the most widely used machine learning libraries in the machine learning community the reason behind that is the ease of code and availability of approximately all functionalities which a machine learning developer will need to build a machine learning model.
Recognizing handwritten digits is a common task in machine learning, often tackled using the scikit-learn library in Python. By employing algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Random Forests, scikit-learn can efficiently classify handwritten digits from datasets like MNIST. Through preprocessing techniques like normalization and dimensionality reduction, scikit-learn streamlines the recognition process, making it accessible for various applications.
